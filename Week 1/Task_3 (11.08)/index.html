    <p> <strong> Lorem Ipsum </strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <em><b>Lorem Ipsum</b></em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <mark style="background-color: aquamarine;">Letraset</mark> sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum </p>
