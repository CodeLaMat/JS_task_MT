// Make a program that asks repeatedly from the user the distance (km) and time (h) and calculates average speed. The program ends when user gives 0 for the distance. (After getting 0, the program does not ask anything from the user.)

do {   x = prompt("Please enter the distance in km."); 
        y = prompt("Please enter the spent time in hour"); 
        console.log(x/y);
